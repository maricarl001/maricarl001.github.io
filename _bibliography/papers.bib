 abstract={In the aftermath of a disaster, news and research attention is focused almost entirely on catastrophic narratives and the various drivers that may have led to the disaster. Learning from failure is essential to preventing future disasters. However, hyperfixation on the catastrophe obscures potential successes at the local scale, which could serve as important examples and learning resources in effective risk mitigation. To highlight effective risk mitigation actions that would otherwise remain unnoticed, we propose the use of probabilistic downward counterfactual analysis. This approach uses counterfactual modelling of a past hazard event with consequences made worse (i.e. downward counterfactual) by the absence of the mitigation intervention. The approach follows probabilistic risk analysis procedures where uncertainties in the simulated events and outcomes are accounted for and propagated. We demonstrate the method using a case study of Nepal’s School Earthquake Safety Program, implemented before the 2015 M<sub>w</sub> 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. Using a school building database for Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, we present two applications: 1) the quantification of lives saved during the Gorkha earthquake as a result of the retrofitting of schools in Kathmandu Valley since 1997, 2) the quantification of the annual expected lives saved if the pilot retrofitting program was extended to all school buildings in Kathmandu Valley based on a probabilistic seismic hazard model. The shift in focus from realised outcome to counterfactual alternative enables the quantification of the benefits of risk reduction programs amidst disaster, or for a hazard that has yet to unfold. Such quantified counterfactual analysis can be used to celebrate successful risk reduction interventions, providing important positive reinforcement to decision-makers with political bravery to commit to the implementation of effective measures.}

  abstract={The goal of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) is to ensure that society continues to function, thrive, and recover quickly despite shocks arising from natural or human actions; to ensure, in short, that natural hazards do not become disasters. Success in the world of DRM means 'nothing happens,' but this poses a dilemma towards recognising and incentivising successful DRM interventions since they are made invisible by the very nature of their success. How then do we highlight and learn from successes if we do not see them? Likewise, how do we incentivise policymakers to make better risk-informed decisions when they are not credited for pro-active actions nor accountable for the consequences of doing nothing? This study discusses four types of situations where successful DRM interventions are made invisible: (i) success made invisible in the midst of broader disaster, (ii) success made invisible by nature of the success, (iii) success made invisible due to yet unrealised benefits, (iv) success made invisible due to the randomness of the specific outcome. We propose the use of probabilistic counterfactual analysis to calculate and highlight the `probabilistic lives saved' from disaster risk management interventions, that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Two case-studies are provided, a school seismic retrofit program in Nepal and a cyclone evacuation effort in India. An important conclusion that emerges from these studies is that the value of risk reduction interventions should not be judged on the basis of specific outcomes, but on the basis of a broader exploration of potential outcomes. The shift in focus from realised outcome to counterfactual alternative provides a framework to identify and learn from successes in DRM, and reward individuals and institutions who have displayed political bravery in committing to the implementation of DRM measures despite invisible benefits.}

 abstract={While thousands of lives are saved through effective earthquake risk reduction programs, very few opportunities exist to celebrate such successes. First, if the tangible benefits of such interventions are only felt in the advent of a large earthquake, there is often a large time-delay between the intervention and its benefits. Second, large earthquakes are rarely an appropriate time for celebration since even small losses cause suffering, and the argument that losses could have been worse had it not been for a successful risk reduction program is not particularly heartening for those who have nevertheless suffered. Therefore, we are calling for a more systematic assessment of probabilistic lives saved (or avoided losses) from earthquake risk reduction actions, and celebration of these successes before risk reduction programs demonstrate their benefits. To address this challenge, this work presents a stochastic framework to estimate the mitigation effect of large-scale earthquake risk reduction measures in terms of probabilistic lives saved. The framework implements a counterfactual approach by analysing the probabilistic consequences of an earthquake had a certain risk reduction program not been implemented beforehand. Two main applications are presented: (1) Calculating the benefits of an earthquake risk mitigation action in an actual past earthquake, and (2) calculating probabilistic benefits over the lifetime of an intervention. For the former, probabilistic realizations of earthquake casualties without the risk intervention are modelled and compared with actual losses-a powerful representation of the success of a risk intervention. For the latter, probabilistic lives saved are calculated based on the hazard model rather than an actual past event. Since future risk is dynamic, we further make use of recently developed time-dependent exposure and vulnerability models to study long-term risk. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the use of counterfactual probabilistic risk analysis as a method for assessing probabilistic benefits of disaster risk reduction actions, so that they may be celebrated. We hope that such methods could someday lead to a "Probabilistic Lives Saved Award," newspaper headlines highlighting disaster risk reduction successes, and ultimately reinforce more investments in such earthquake risk reduction policies and actions.}

abstract={The typical process of engineering risk analysis assumes a static state of vulnerability through the lifespan of the structure. However many civil engineering systems change states over time causing significant impact on their vulnerability. Such dynamic changes may involve an increase in vulnerability driven by deterioration processes (e.g. corrosion, fatigue, creep, hazard-induced damage, etc.), or an decrease in vulnerability driven by strengthening interventions (e.g. retrofitting, maintenance, building replacement, etc.). Accounting for these dynamics is critical to properly understand hazard-related risk of civil engineering systems over their lifespan. This paper presents a stochastic framework for accounting for time and state dependent vulnerability in risk analysis of civil engineering systems. Time-homogeneous Markov chains are used to model various state change processes, and integrated within the risk analysis framework in closed-form expressions. Several applications are demonstrated: (1) quantifying risk of structurally deteriorating buildings and the risk reduction impact of maintenance, (2) urban-scale seismic retrofitting policies based on various retrofit rates, and (3) impact of varying building replacement rates to higher code standards. These demonstrate the importance of accounting for time dependent state change as a significant factor in the lifespan vulnerability of the built environment. It further provides a method to study and compare various risk reduction policies.}

  abstract={Super typhoon Haiyan, considered as one of the most powerful storms recorded in 2013, devastated the central Philippines region on 8 November 2013 with damage amounting to more than USD 2 billion. Hardest hit is the province of Leyte which is located in central Philippines. Rehabilitation of the areas that were devastated requires detailed hazard maps as a basis for well-planned reconstruction. Along with severe wind, storm surge, and flood hazard maps, detailed landslide susceptibility maps for the cities and municipalities of Leyte (7246.7 km2 ) province are necessary. In order to rapidly assess and delineate areas susceptible to rainfall-induced shallow landslides, Stability INdex MAPping (SINMAP) software was used over a 5-m Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-derived digital terrain model (DTM) grid. Topographic, soil strength, and hydrologic parameters were used for each pixel of a given DTM grid to compute for the corresponding factor of safety. The landslide maps generated using SINMAP are highly consistent with the landslide inventory derived from high-resolution satellite imagery from 2002 to 2014 with a detection percentage of 97.5% and missing factor of 0.025. These demonstrate that SINMAP performs well despite the lack of an extensive geotechnical and hydrological database in the study area. The detailed landslide susceptibility classification is useful to identify safe and unsafe areas for reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. These maps complement the debris flow and structurally controlled landslide hazard maps that are also being prepared for rebuilding Haiyan's devastated areas.},
