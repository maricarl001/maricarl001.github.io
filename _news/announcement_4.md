Our work on celebrating successes in #DisasterRiskReduction is featured in [Thomson Reuters Foundation News](https://news.trust.org/item/20220309084651-say6j/). In the conversation, my PhD adviser David Lallemant and I share the importance and need to recognize successful efforts to avert disasters. Celebrating such efforts is important to ensure that we learn from, replicate, adapt and/or scale programs that are already working. Amid growing eco-anxiety, it is important to remember that we already have some of the solutions. 

Know of a project that successfully averted a disaster? Submit nominations for the Averted Disaster Award supported by the Understanding Risk Community (UR) and the World Bank. The deadline is on April 15: https://averteddisasteraward.org

And read our scientific paper describing how to identify, quantify and highlight successful disaster risk reduction interventions that are otherwise invisible: https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/153502 Part of upcoming [United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) Global Assessment Report 2022](https://gar.undrr.org).
